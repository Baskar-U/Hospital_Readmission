# Repository Setup Guide

Your Hospital Readmission project is now properly configured with Git and sensitive data protection. Here's how to add it to a remote repository:

## üîí Security Status ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` file created and configured
- ‚úÖ Sensitive data files removed from tracking
- ‚úÖ Data directory structure maintained with `.gitkeep`
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive README.md created
- ‚úÖ All sensitive files are now ignored by Git

## üìã Files Protected by .gitignore

The following files and directories are now protected and will NOT be uploaded to your repository:

- `data/*.csv` - Your hospital readmissions data
- `data/*.xlsx`, `data/*.json`, etc. - Any other data files
- `*.pkl`, `*.model`, `*.joblib` - Model files
- `attached_assets/` - Debug files and assets
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache files
- `.local/`, `.config/` - Local configuration
- `.streamlit/secrets.toml` - Streamlit secrets
- Various other sensitive and temporary files

## üöÄ Adding to Remote Repository

### Option 1: GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it `HospitalReadmission` or similar
   - Make it private for extra security
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Add the remote and push**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HospitalReadmission.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: GitLab

1. **Create a new project on GitLab**:
   - Go to https://gitlab.com/projects/new
   - Name it `HospitalReadmission`
   - Make it private
   - Don't initialize with README

2. **Add the remote and push**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HospitalReadmission.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Azure DevOps

1. **Create a new repository in Azure DevOps**:
   - Go to your Azure DevOps project
   - Create a new repository
   - Name it `HospitalReadmission`

2. **Add the remote and push**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_PROJECT/_git/HospitalReadmission
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## üîç Verify Security

After pushing, verify that sensitive files are NOT in your remote repository:

1. Check your repository online
2. Confirm that `data/hospital_readmissions.csv` is NOT visible
3. Confirm that `attached_assets/` directory is NOT visible
4. Verify that only the code files and documentation are present

## üìÅ What Will Be Uploaded

‚úÖ **Safe to upload**:
- `app.py` - Main application
- `data_processor.py` - Data processing code
- `model_trainer.py` - Model training code
- `explainer.py` - Model explanation code
- `utils.py` - Utility functions
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `data/.gitkeep` - Empty file to maintain directory structure

‚ùå **Protected (NOT uploaded)**:
- `data/hospital_readmissions.csv` - Your sensitive data
- `attached_assets/` - Debug files and assets
- Any model files (`.pkl`, `.joblib`, etc.)
- Configuration files with secrets
- Cache and temporary files

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Use a private repository** for extra security
2. **Enable branch protection** rules if available
3. **Use environment variables** for any API keys or secrets
4. **Regularly audit** what's being committed
5. **Consider using Git LFS** for large files if needed in the future

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If you see sensitive files in your remote repository:

1. **Remove them immediately**:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached sensitive_file.csv
   git commit -m "Remove sensitive file"
   git push
   ```

2. **Check your .gitignore** is working:
   ```bash
   git status --ignored
   ```

3. **Force push if needed** (be careful):
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. Choose your Git hosting platform
2. Create a new repository
3. Add the remote and push your code
4. Verify sensitive data is not uploaded
5. Share the repository URL with collaborators (if needed)

Your project is now ready for secure version control! üéâ
