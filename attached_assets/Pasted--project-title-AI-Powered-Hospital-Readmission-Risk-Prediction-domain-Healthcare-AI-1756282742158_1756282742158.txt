  "domain": "Healthcare AI / Predictive Analytics",
  "objective": "Design and implement an advanced AI system capable of accurately predicting hospital readmissions within a defined time horizon, enabling proactive interventions, cost reduction, and improved patient outcomes.",
  "data_source": {
    "url": "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/hospital-readmissions",
    "description": "Patient-level dataset including demographics, comorbidities, prior admissions, length of stay, and discharge details for predicting readmission likelihood."
  },
  "problem_statement": "Hospital readmissions represent a massive financial and operational burden for healthcare systems worldwide. Traditional rule-based or manually-engineered models lack scalability, are highly dataset-specific, and fail to generalize across patient populations. An intelligent, AI-driven framework is required to capture hidden correlations in clinical data, balance interpretability with accuracy, and provide actionable insights to physicians.",

  "impact": "By predicting readmissions with high precision, this AI system can help hospitals prioritize high-risk patients, reduce unnecessary costs, optimize bed availability, and most importantly, improve patient safety and quality of care.",
  "vision": "To create a scalable, explainable, and clinically integrated AI solution that sets a global benchmark in predictive healthcare. The system should evolve into a universal readmission risk engine adaptable across geographies, datasets, and hospital infrastructures."
